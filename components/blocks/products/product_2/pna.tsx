					α-alkenyl sodium sulfonate is a kind of anionic surfactant prepared
					from α-olefin by sulphonation and continuous neutralization of sulfur
					trioxide vapor film. AOS has excellent emulsification, decontamination
					and calcium soap dispersibility, solubility, compatibility, fine and
					rich foam, easy biodegradation, low toxicity, little irritation to the
					skin and other characteristics, especially when used in non-phosphorus
					detergent, not only can maintain a good washing ability, but also good
					compatibility with enzyme preparations. The fluidity of powder
					products is good. Therefore, it can be widely used in all kinds of
					household washing products such as phosphorus-free laundry powder,
					liquid detergent, textile printing and dyeing industry, petrochemical,
					industrial hard surface cleaning.
