                    The product is used for foaming in the production process of paper gypsum board. The process is to introduce air into the diluted blowing agent and disperse it evenly to achieve the contact surface of liquid gas as large as possible, so that the surface active substance in the blowing agent forms a double electric layer on the surface of the liquid film and wraps the air, forming a thin and dense foam. When the foaming agent and gypsum hydrate, the intermolecular force â€” hydrogen chain is generated, resulting in steric hindrance, resulting in the lack of gypsum lattice structure. Stimulate gypsum activity, accelerate the formation of network gypsum skeleton, so as to enhance the strength of gypsum board, reduce the capacity of gypsum board, greatly save raw materials, and fully improve the physical properties of gypsum board.
