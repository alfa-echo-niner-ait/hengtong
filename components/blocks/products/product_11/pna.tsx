					N-octyl sodium sulfate is a kind of bubble free surfactant, which is
					widely used as detergent, penetrant softener, emulsifier, filament
					agent and viscosity control agent. It can be used for skim cleaning,
					tableware, fruit and vegetable cleaning, hard surface cleaning,
					alkaline washing, metal processing cleaning, food polymer synthesis,
					electroplating, paper making, textile, tanning, etc.
					<br />
					<br />
					In electroplating, it can be used as a low bubble wetting agent for
					nickel plating; acid zinc plating or zinc alloy solution can improve
					the turbidity point of the plating solution. In terms of washing
					solution, it is very stable even in high electrolyte or in the
					presence of chlorine or multivalent cations, effectively wetting,
					reducing the viscosity of the mixture, improving the permeability of
					cleaning agent on hard surfaces, and promoting the water solubility of
					dirt.
					<br />
					<br />
					Esion synthesis, suitable for vinyl acetate emulsion, vinyl chloride,
					acrylonitrile, acrylate based emulsion system, especially suitable for
					making resistant emulsion.
