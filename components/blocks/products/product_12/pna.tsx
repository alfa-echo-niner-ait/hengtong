					Is easy to dissolve in water, has good dispersibility, good
					compatibility with hard water and higher electrolyte stability. High
					temperature resistance, alkali resistance, excellent emulsification,
					foaming and hard water resistance, excellent permeability. It is an
					excellent emulsifier, penetrant, dispersant, degreaser and lubricant.
					It is suitable for neutral and alkaline media.It is often used in
					detergent, metal processing, electroplating, papermaking, photographic
					materials, plywood, polymer synthesis, textile, leather and other
					industries. Especially in the electroplating and washing liquid
					industry.
					<br />
					<br />
					Low foam wetting agent for nickel plating; can be used as primary
					brightener, low foam wetting agent for nickel plating, and can be used
					for acid zinc or zinc alloy plating solution to improve the cloud
					point of the plating solution;In terms of cleaning liquids, they can
					be used as wetting agents in corresponding media, which can reduce the
					viscosity of surfactant mixtures, significantly improve the wetting
					penetration of liquid cleaning agents on hard surfaces, and promote
					the water solubility of dirt.
					<br />
					<br />
					Increases wetting effect and reduces pitting and pinholes. Suitable
					for mechanical or air agitation. It is also stable in highly
					electrolytic systems or in the presence of chlorine donors, even in
					the presence of polyvalent cations, and is particularly suitable for
					the formulation of heavy duty alkaline detergents.
					<br />
					<br />
					It has excellent solubility, stability and permeability in strong
					alkaline solution, and is used to manufacture anti-concentrated alkali
					refining agent and mercerizing penetrating agent for printing and
					dyeing pretreatment. In the aspect of emulsion synthesis, it is
					suitable for polymerization or copolymerization of emulsion system
					based on vinyl acetate, acrylate, vinyl acetate-acrylate, vinyl
					chloride and acrylonitrile, especially for the preparation of
					alkali-resistant acrylate polymer resin emulsion.
