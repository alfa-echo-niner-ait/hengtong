					Is easy to dissolve in water, has good dispersibility, good
					compatibility with hard water and higher electrolyte stability. High
					temperature resistance, alkali resistance, excellent emulsification,
					foaming and hard water resistance, excellent permeability.
					<br />
					<br />
					It is an excellent emulsifier, penetrant, dispersant, degreaser and
					lubricant. It is suitable for neutral and alkaline media. It is often
					used in detergent, metal processing, electroplating, papermaking,
					photographic materials, plywood, polymer synthesis, textile, leather
					and other industries.
					<br />
					<br />
					Especially in the electroplating and washing liquid industry. In the
					aspect of emulsion synthesis, it can be used as solubilizer, wetting
					agent and auxiliary emulsifier in emulsion polymerization, it is
					suitable for polymerization or copolymerization of emulsion system
					based on vinyl acetate, acrylate, vinyl acetate-acrylate, vinyl
					chloride and acrylonitrile, especially for the preparation of
					alkali-resistant acrylate polymer resin emulsion.
